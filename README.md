# Federated Learning in TensorFlow [Video]
This is the code repository for [Federated Learning in TensorFlow [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/federated-learning-tensorflow-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Federated learning is revolutionizing how machine learning models are trained. TensorFlow Federated is the first production-level federated learning platform that makes it easy to build mobile device learning-based applications. In this course, you’ll learn the basics of building Federated Learning models that can be gradually improved by decentralized data that comes from a variety of mobile devices while not violating the privacy of end users.

You’ll start by exploring the nature of problems that TensorFlow Federated helps to solve and you’ll install the necessary software. After that, we’ll jump straight into improving an image classification model using a bunch of samples of decentralized data from specially prepared MNIST dataset. Then you’ll start working with text and apply Federated Learning to text generation using a pre-trained model on Charles Dickens' texts. Next, you’ll handle a text classification problem with TensorFlow Federated where you’ll use a movie reviews dataset.

By the end of this course, you’ll have the practical skills to prepare both datasets and models for Federated Learning as well as the ability to train and evaluate your own models in TensorFlow Federated.
